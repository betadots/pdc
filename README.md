This repository contains the code for the betadots Puppet Development Container (PDC).

## Usage

```shell
docker run -ti --rm ghcr.io:betadots/pdc:latest bash
```

Rather than using bash directly, you have the option to mount the repository and run a script.

Included fixed software versions, see: [build_versions.json](build_versions.json)

For any given container tag you can lookup the specific versions here: `https://github.com/betadots/pdc/blob/$TAG/build_versions.json`

## Version schema

The version schema has the following layout:

```text
v<container.major>.<container.minor>.<container.patch>-<puppet.major>
```

Example usage:

```shell
docker run -ti --rm ghcr.io:betadots/pdc:v1.0.1-8 bash
```

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| container.major | Describes the major version of the base container (Ubunutu 22.04) or incompatible changes |
| container.minor | Describes new features or refactoring with backward compatibility |
| container.patch | Describes if minor changes or bugfixes have been implemented |
| puppet.major | Describes the contained major Puppet version (7 or 8) |

### other tags

```text
latest
latest-<puppet.major>
main-<puppet.major>
```

`latest` should be self-explanatory. The `main` tags are built with every push to the main branch and can be regarded as development tags.

### Version updates

PDC will update its minor version to align with minor version updates of the tools it encapsulates. A major version update of any tool, the base container, or incompatible changes in the container build setup will trigger a major version update of PDC.
